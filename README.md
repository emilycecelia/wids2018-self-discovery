## Women in Data Science 2018
# Self-Discovery with Python
<i>These days, many of us store all of our data with cloud providers, and it is a known fact that the amount of data we willingly share about ourselves is enormous.  In this workshop, we will explore a sample of search history data to see what we can learn about an individual.  But first, we must learn how to parse and clean our data, as well as extract meaningful features.  For, as we know, the journey to self discovery requires a lot of cleaning up and hard work!  We will use regular expressions and the BeautifulSoup and pandas libraries in Python to extract, clean, and analyze the rich data we create with a simple search.  You will enjoy this workshop the most if you have at least a basic understanding of Python fundamentals: lists, iteration, and functions.</i>
